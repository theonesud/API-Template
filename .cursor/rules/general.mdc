All environment variables are stored in the hidden /.env file. They are parsed and checked in [config.py](mdc:config.py).

Always use this exact structure to use environment variables:
```python
from config import settings
print(settings.ENV_VAR_NAME)
```
Never use something like `VARIABLE = os.getenv("VARIABLE")`.
